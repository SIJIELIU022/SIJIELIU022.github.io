#### Bio

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Old Dominion University, advised by [Professor Qing Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/qingtang).  
My research focuses on developing trustworthy end-to-end AI models and simulation approaches in the field of autonomous and connected vehicles. 
 
Before coming ODU, I worked at one traffic research and design institute in China, where I gained three years of experience in transportation consulting and simulation. I hold an M.Sc. degree from the University of Manchester in the UK and a B.Eng. degree from Hebei University of Technology in China.

I enjoy traveling and exploring different cultures, cuisines, and lifestyles around the world. In my spare time, I like watching football matches, especially the English Premier League, and I also enjoy playing football.
